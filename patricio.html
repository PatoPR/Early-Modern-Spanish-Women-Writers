                Patricio Robles is a Ph.D. candidate in Hispanic Studies at UBC. His dissertation examines texts about nature in the Southern Cone (Patagonia and Pampas). Focusing on the intersection of Affective theory and Ecocritical analysis, Patricio investigates how nature and culture have been perceived in post-Independence travel writing, gauchesca literature, and contemporary novels. He studied Anthropology at the University of Buenos Aires and Environmental Studies at FLACSO (Latin American Social Sciences Institute).

                Patricio has been responsible for the website’s design and for incorporating external visualization tools to enhance the user experience. He has also been our primary liaison with the digital humanities staff at UBC, ensuring that we stay up-to-date on the latest developments.
                
                In addition to his work on the website, Patricio has been involved in compiling our annotated bibliography of Mariana de Carvajal y Saavedra.
