              María Fernanda Guzmán was born in Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico, and has loved to write since she was little. She studied literature at the Universidad de las Américas Puebla and had two academic exchanges at City Beijing University (China) and the University of Salamanca (Spain). She just finished her M.A. in Hispanic Studies at the University of British Columbia. She has worked as an editor of books published by the Management of the Historic Center of Puebla. She was also a high school teacher at Prepa Anahuac Puebla. Her tastes are diverse: she likes to stream video games, read historical novels and write fantasy. She recently published her first book Arcángel: los niños elegidos.
