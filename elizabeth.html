Elizabeth S. Lagresa-González obtained her Ph.D. in Romance Languages and Literatures from Harvard University and is an Assistant Professor at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. She specializes in early modern Spanish literature and culture, which she addresses at the intersection of gender, cross-cultural, visual and material studies. She has published multiple peer-reviewed articles, a critical edition and English translation of Bernat Metge’s Lo Somni / The Dream, as well as a forthcoming co-edited volume on “Literature and Economy in Spain and Beyond” from the Revista Canadiense de Estudios Hispánicos. Her monograph, titled “The Business of Romance,” examines the transculturation of objects and female subjects across national and disciplinary borders through the lens of new economic and material criticism.
